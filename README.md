# qb-blackmarket
A simple black market script that uses my version of the qb-phone


### Special Note
This script may or may not be plug-and-play with whatever framework/server you are using. I use mongodb and have left those queries in place, as I cba to put in any effort to make this work with whatever frameworks or versions are out there. It is up to YOU to make this code work in your server. There may be incomplete features, I can't remember what features might be unfinished. I will not be providing support for this. Best of luck.


### Features
 - Use my version of qb-phone to browse available items, via [my qb-phone](https://github.com/JoeSzymkowiczFiveM/qb-phone)
 - Randomized ped spawning for upon server open
 - Dark Log entry when you purchase item using crypto, letting you know where black market pickup is
 - Purchased items are stored in the database until pickup
